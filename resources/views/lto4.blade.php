        <p>7.	Must have passed the practical examination.
        <p>It is important that you know how to drive first before you apply for a driver’s license. You can bring your own car/motorcycle for actual driving examination, or you could use their car/motorcycle, both have fees.

        <p>You can apply at any licensing center/district office with new driver’s license transactions.

        <h2 class="title">Procedures</h2>
        <p>Procedures for applying a professional driver’s license:
        <p>1.	Go to the customer service counter to get your checklist of requirements and secure a driver’s license application form. You can accomplish this form prior to transacting your business at the LTO. Get a queue number.
        <p>2.	When your number is called, go to the evaluator counter and submit all the required documents and have it checked for completeness and authenticity.
        <p>3.	When your name is called, go to where your photo and signature will be taken.
        <p>4.	Go to the cashier to pay the application fee.
        <p>5.	Go to the Examination Room for the lecture and written exam (You can review the LTO exam here).
        <p>6.	After passing the written exam, wait for your name to be called for the practical exam.
        <p>7.	After passing the practical exam, go to the Cashier when your name is called for payment of necessary fees and obtain an official receipt (OR).
        <p>8.	Go to the releasing counter, wait for your name to be called and present the OR and claim the card type license.

        <p>Fees and charges for applying a professional driver’s license:

        <p>Total:	P585.26 - P820.26

        <h4 class="title">Remember:</h4>
        <p>1.	Never apply with fixers. It’s easy to apply for a Non-Professional Driver’s License, you can do it on your own. Be punctual, in my experience when I applied at noon, there is a little chance of getting into their quota. Perhaps if you go to the LTO office early in the morning (around 6:00 a.m.) you could have a higher chance. Be patient, there are several steps in order for you to obtain a driver’s license. Driving is a passion, so is waiting.
        <p>2.	Professional Driver’s License will expire after three five (5) years at your birthday of the expiry year. You should renew it before its expiry day to avoid penalties and charges
        <p>3.	Professional Driver’s License entitles you drive PUV (Public Utility Vehicle) like jeepneys, tricycles, taxis, buses, etc.
